  2 # This is the ssh client system-wide configuration file.  See
  3 # ssh_config(5) for more information.  This file provides defaults for
  4 # users, and the values can be changed in per-user configuration files
  5 # or on the command line.

  7 # Configuration data is parsed as follows:
  8 #  1. command line options
  9 #  2. user-specific file
 10 #  3. system-wide file
 11 # Any configuration value is only changed the first time it is set.
 12 # Thus, host-specific definitions should be at the beginning of the
 13 # configuration file, and defaults at the end.
 14 
 15 # Site-wide defaults for some commonly used options.  For a comprehensive
 16 # list of available options, their meanings and defaults, please see the
 17 # ssh_config(5) man page.
